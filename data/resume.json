    hobby back in undegraduate school became a profession (programmer).<br> I do mostly \
    back-end (Python, some PHP) and most recently front-end (JavaScript). <br>I am passionate about \
    cosmic-rays, nuclear physics and electronics.<br> Since January 2023 I started working as a contractor at TG in Inazawa.",
